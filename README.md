## 🐛 COMMON MISTAKES & HOW TO FIX

### ❌ Website shows blank page
**Fix:** Make sure index.html is in the ROOT of your repository (not in a folder)

### ❌ Products don't show
**Fix:** Check products.json for syntax errors (missing commas, quotes)

### ❌ Changes don't appear
**Fix:** Wait 2-3 minutes after committing, then hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### ❌ Image doesn't show
**Fix:** Make sure image URL starts with `https://` and ends with image extension (.jpg, .png)

## 📝 EDITING REVIEWS

In **products.json**, scroll to the `"reviews"` section:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Customer Name",
  "location": "City, Country",
  "rating": 5,                    ← 1 to 5
  "product": "Product Name",
  "comment": "Review text here",
  "verified": true,               ← true or false
  "date": "2024-01-15"           ← YYYY-MM-DD format
}
```

   - Click "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"
   - Click "Console" tab
   - Look for red errors
   - Copy the error and search Google

2. **Common issues:**
   - Missing comma in JSON = syntax error
   - Wrong image URL = broken image
   - Wrong category name = product won't filter correctly

---

## 🔮 WHAT'S NEXT? (Future Enhancements)

When you're ready, we can add:

1. **Real Email Forms** (using FormSubmit or EmailJS - FREE)
2. **Shopping Cart** (using LocalStorage - already works in browser)
3. **Newsletter System** (using Mailchimp - FREE tier)
4. **Google Analytics** (track visitors - FREE)
5. **Custom Domain** (yourdomain.com instead of github.io)

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Always test locally first:** Download both files, open index.html in browser
2. **Make small changes:** Don't edit everything at once
3. **Keep backups:** Download your files before major changes
4. **Use proper image sizes:** 800x800px for product images works great
5. **Check on mobile:** View your site on your phone after changes
